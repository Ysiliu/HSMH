The HSMH source code, including the simulator part, and experiment results in the paper "An Efficient Approach for Improving Message Acceptance Rate and Link Utilization in Time-Sensitive Networking"

component: Contains various components that make up a network, including switch, host, link, gcl, flow, flowset, fifoqueue, heapqueue, node, port, and routetable.

config: Used to set some parameters in the network.

data: generate_data.py is used to randomly generate some flow data in the network.

simulation: simulation_BT.py, simulation_PASA.py, simulation_EDF.py, and simulation_HSMH.py denote the 4 algorithms described in the paper "An Efficient Approach for Improving Message Acceptance Rate and Link Utilization in Time-Sensitive Networking", respectively.
